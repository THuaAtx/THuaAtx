- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @THuaAtx. I am a Product Development Intern in the Digital Enabling Technologies team at Arthrex. My internship lasts for 11 weeks during the summer of 2023, from May 20th to August 4th.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things related to biomedical engineering. Of course, as an Arthrex intern, my peak interest at the moment is orthopedic surgery. Outside of work, I like to explore topics of neuroscience, hemodynamics, and more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Finite Element Analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, and Robotics. Also looking into coding languages (Python, C, C++, C#/.NET), virtual reality (Unity, Unreal), and ROS.
- ðŸ“« After my internship, you may reach me at thai.hua0922@gmail.com. I am currently planning to do a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Central Florida.
